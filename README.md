## Javascript e-commerce interface.

E-commerce app concept interface, made fully dynamic in vanilla js, css , html.

### About

The purpose of this project was to use local storage and implement some cart features.
I also use fetch API to get the external data and make crud operations, the user should be able to post a product and search for it, also deletes and/or updates directly to the server.

### Project Structure

- Home page
- Cart page
- Post page

Javascript modules were used and the project is structured with pages and components, similar to a react project. I am also experimenting with webpack and with bundling in general so don't be surprised if there is something going wrong with the config file.

### Features to be implemented

* I would like to split the code in chunks with webpack, so the file sizes diminishes on production. I know that I should be using import() or require.ensure but could not figure it out yet how to set it up. If someone knows how to do it would be more than welcome. Cheers!
