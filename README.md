## Javascript e-commerce interface.

E-commerce app concept interface, made fully dynamic in vanilla js, css , html.

### About

The purpose of this project was to use local storage and implement some cart features.
I also use fetch API to get the external data and make crud operations, the user should be able to post a product and search for it, also deletes and/or updates.

### Project Structure

- Home page
- Cart page
- Post page

Javascript modules were used and the project is structured with pages and components, similar to a react project. I am also experimenting with webpack and with bundling in general so don't be surprised if there is something going wrong with the config file.
